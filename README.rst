=========================
Sequana Pipeline Template
=========================

:version: 1.0

This repository is a Cookiecutter template to start a new `Sequana pipeline <https://sequana.readthedocs.io>`_ 
implementation from scratch.


Quickstart
----------

You first need to install the latest version of **cookiecutter** if you haven't installed it yet (requires
Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher)::

    pip install -U cookiecutter

Then, no need to install the sequana_pipeline_template package itself. You can call it directly from github as
follows::

    cookiecutter https://github.com/sequana/sequana_pipeline_template.git

you will be asked some questions in particular the name of the package. You can
change things later on. Except the name, most entries are populated in the
setup.py file.

- The first question asks the name of the future pipeline. There is no strict
convention in Sequana but we usually use small caps and underscores to separate
words (e.g., sequana_rnaseq).

- The second question is the short description that will be added to your
setup.py configuration file

- The third questions asked for keywords, also added to the setup.py

That's it.


If your pipeline is called **varseq**, you should end up with a structure in the
directory **sequana_varseq** similar to ::


similar to ::

    ├── test
    │   └── __init__.py
    ├── doc
    │   ├── conf.py
    │   ├── index.rst
    │   └── Makefile
    ├── README.rst
    ├── requirements.txt
    ├── sequana_pipelines
    │   └── varseq
    │       ├── config.yaml
    │       ├── __init__.py
    │       ├── main.py
    │       ├── varseq.rules
    │       ├── README.rst
    │       ├── requirements.txt
    │       └── schema.yaml
    │       └── data
    │           ├── __init__.py
    ├── setup.cfg
    └── setup.py

You can install this new pipeline as follows::

    cd sequana_varseq
    python setup.py install

You can build the documentation as follows::

    cd sequana_varseq/doc
    make html  # under linux

Or test it::

    cd sequana_varseq
    pytest  # this tool (pytest) must be install first (pip install pytest)

Of course, you now need to work a little bit by replacing the content of some
files with your code and/or documentation and tests.

The most important editing steps are then:

1. to edit the *config.yaml* and *varseq.rules* in the sequana_pipelines/varseq
   directory with your own snakemake pipeline and configuration file.
2. edit the main script **main.py** and adapt it to your needs. This will be the
   entry point of the user.
3. the documentation in ./doc
4. test in ./test
5. update the requirements.txt file in varseq/ directory to add any external
   dependencies. The requirements.txt at the top level is only for Python
   dependencies. In principle it depends only on sequana

Once done, create a repository on https://github.com/sequana/sequana_varseq and
upload your files. 

This is not perfect and we will most probably edit this template in the future
to make it more robust and possibly add such features (help needed).

Once happy, you can create a local repository::

    git init

Then, commit and push you files and push to a remote repositoty. For example::

    git remote add origin https://github.com/your_repo
    git push --set-upstream origin main
